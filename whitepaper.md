## Fact Findings 

### What is P2P Lending?

Peer to peer means a borrower is connected directly to the lender without FI through an online platform.
Users usually signs up for the service , user should go through a basic verification check such as valid ID’s and Home address and Bank Account Details and a minimum credit score ,then user is qualified as borrowers and is a allowed to make online listing and then lenders(user who invest) bid on the  listing , then bid amount is locked. There are certain rules to prevent gamification of the rules through  online paltform. Usually platforms charge 2 % from lenders for screening a borrower , they  Provide one step documentation and acts as an arbitrator.

Once the loan is funded the loan status becomes current and repayment schedule is generated , usually on the online platforms. 


### How does collections work?

If borrowers end up paying late , then it is sent to collection agency.  (Delinquencies are reported also to credit agency.)


## Data varibales acts as deciding factors for P2P Loan

### Friendship as internal social capital - 
Borrowers with friends are more likely to have their loan requests funded and that these loans have lower interest rates, friendship lowers default probability.

### Apperance as a variable 
The role of appearance  -- borrowers who appear more trustworthy have higher probabilities of obtaining a loan and pay lower interest rates than do borrowers who appear less trustworthy. This finding suggests that appearance-based impressions affect individuals -- find that borrowers who appear more trustworthy indeed have better credit scores and lower default rates than do borrowers who appear less trustworthy. This finding could indicate that appearance conveys information about an individual’s reputational capital. -- trustworthy appearance and trustworthy behavior could be linked through common biological factors.


### Funding probability based on different dimensions / variables ? WIP


### Role of FI
Financial insitutions are not required in this process ,since information about borrowers is collected privately through different means and is analysed and then sent to the FI/Lenders to disburse loans. (Note there can be many lenders or just a single lender).Once the information is collected then it can be processed to larger FI for further loan approval and disbursal.

### Why does it work?
P2P lending platforms made person-to-person loans economically viable on a national scale by reducing the search costs and other transaction costs inherent in traditional person-to-person loans. P2P lending platforms reduce search costs.

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) have increased credit availability to the poor and reduced interest rates from those charged by conventional money lenders significantly, by overcoming information asymmetry and monitoring problems by innovative techniques. 


###  Risks involved in P2P
Well-documented privacy risks are involved because P2P platforms collect and store substantial personal identification and credit data which can be sold or hacked.

### Stakeholders
The platforms that advertise and enforce the loans have little direct stake in loan repayment 

### Traiditional P2P Screening problem
Vetting a borrower on a centralised platform is risky and prone to fraud.

## Core Idea

The idea behind "Finocial" in 2015 was to somehow come up with a platform which is the best of social network and finance.
After failing in providing the rationale behind what values we are giving to customers and how investor is going to come on the platform.
Peer to peer platform was the key design from the very begining where one can go through the process of credit check which banks
were majorly relying on and has to be done through them only. (Every digital lender is merely a sourcing partner.) Nothing more. 

This regulatory hurdle proved to be an issue for the project. There were no way we can move aside from banking regulatory and disburse 
and balances funds on our own balance sheet. 

Technoogy integration was the only idea and acting as front face was never the part of project where we have to source customer.

The problem was lying how parties can together come forward and accept these transactions. This was a problem of game theory where many 
players were involved which in turn there has to be a heavy rule driven application / platform which process all of these transactions.

In short we were facing with the issue how to make payment/settlement fast on loan.

After fiddling around an year we came to know about the hype of Blockchain.

What is blockchain?
The underlying technology behind BITCOIN the notorious currency on the web right now sincere but loud enough.

## Present 

When we wish to avail loan through various they require certain documents which needs to be collected by a representative 
which is nothing but just a camera of the bank.

He comes to check who you are? where ? things like this. Imagine bank has sent a camera to your house to assess your condition.

Now once he has the document he will upload it to the server/application if its a DSA then the backend/operation staff will instatnly 
verifies the document now it depends entirely how it happens , small financial companies does it using experience , some companies use algorithms
every department has their own method and algorithms to verify your document around several 1000 plus data pointers are being matched.

Then comes the 3rd party rating check : Customer basic details are entered in the system it generates a score which is a meaning less score
because it is entirely based on the averages of the bank account and transactions inside that bank/savings/credit.

Now the bias has already been created if you are not on the above rating if you are below then its a problem , if you are above you are 
sanctioned a loan but. There is another but.

Now banks will make sure that Can they recover this money from you because they don't trust you even now. 

Banks will ask you a collateral this is the 20th Century business model where one has to deposit the same value of asset to the bank 
to get the funds/liquidity.

Even the asset belongs to bank , customer has to pay huge bank charges/interest rates.
