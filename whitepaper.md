## Core Idea

The idea behind "Finocial" in 2015 was to somehow come up with a platform which is the best of social network and finance.
After failing in providing the rationale behind what values we are giving to customers and how investor is going to come on the platform.
Peer to peer platform was the key design from the very begining where one can go through the process of credit check which banks
were majorly relying on and has to be done through them only. (Every digital lender is merely a sourcing partner.) Nothing more. 

This regulatory hurdle proved to be an issue for the project. There were no way we can move aside from banking regulatory and disburse 
and balances funds on our own balance sheet. 

Technoogy integration was the only idea and acting as front face was never the part of project where we have to source customer.

The problem was lying how parties can together come forward and accept these transactions. This was a problem of game theory where many 
players were involved which in turn there has to be a heavy rule driven application / platform which process all of these transactions.

In short we were facing with the issue how to make payment/settlement fast on loan.

After fiddling around an year we came to know about the hype of Blockchain.

What is blockchain?
The underlying technology behind BITCOIN the notorious currency on the web right now sincere but loud enough.

## Present 

When we wish to avail loan through various they require certain documents which needs to be collected by a representative 
which is nothing but just a camera of the bank.

He comes to check who you are? where ? things like this. Imagine bank has sent a camera to your house to assess your condition.

Now once he has the document he will upload it to the server/application if its a DSA then the backend/operation staff will instatnly 
verifies the document now it depends entirely how it happens , small financial companies does it using experience , some companies use algorithms
every department has their own method and algorithms to verify your document around several 1000 plus data pointers are being matched.

Then comes the 3rd party rating check : Customer basic details are entered in the system it generates a score which is a meaning less score
because it is entirely based on the averages of the bank account and transactions inside that bank/savings/credit.

Now the bias has already been created if you are not on the above rating if you are below then its a problem , if you are above you are 
sanctioned a loan but. There is another but.

Now banks will make sure that Can they recover this money from you because they don't trust you even now. 

Banks will ask you a collateral this is the 20th Century business model where one has to deposit the same value of asset to the bank 
to get the funds/liquidity.

Even the asset belongs to bank , customer has to pay huge bank charges/interest rates.
