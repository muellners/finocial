## Appeal

From ## Maek Twain

Hi, Quite a time.

The idea behind "Finocial" in 2015 was to somehow come up with a platform which is the best of social network and finance. After failing in providing the rationale behind what values we are giving to customers and how investor is going to come on the platform. 

Peer to peer platform which was the key design from the very beginning where one has to go through the process of credit policies of banks and has to be done through them only. (Every digital lender is merely a sourcing partner.) Nothing more.

This regulatory hurdle proved to be an issue for the project. There were no way we can move aside from banking regulatory and disburse and balances funds on our own balance sheet.

Technology integration was the only idea for us  but acting as front face was never the part of project where we have to source customer.

The problem was lying how parties can together come forward and accept these transactions. This was a problem of game theory where many players were involved which in turn there has to be a heavy rule driven application / platform which process all of these transactions. Again a software platform fight?

In short we were facing with the issue how to make payment/settlement which would instantly provide cash.

After fiddling around an year we came to know about the hype of Blockchain.

What is blockchain? The underlying technology behind BITCOIN the notorious currency on the web right now sincere but loud enough.

Now after researching a bit of economics and studying game theory i am able to propose a new version of finocial.

Instant.Liquid.Available.

The idea to liberate millions of people from paying huge charges and interest on loans backed by digital assets and peer to peer lending.

A new generation of credit agency based on blockchain mix of social network and machine driven smart contract financial transactions.

Finocial mission is to provide a platform of social network to those who need instant cash by assessing openly information on a ledger.

Digital Currency Backed Lending and Savings.

I think we dont need enough proof that from where this data will come.

I am talking about building a peer to peer economy within India where one individuals/sme can avail loan instantly without regulatory hurdles. 

Lesson Learned: Regulatory is pain in the ass.

But cryptocurrency are doing it So why cannot we do it.

This is just a gist? 

I know questions would come like how ? What about QE, who will provide the funds? How debt will be collected?


I think we all are smart enough to understand how this is going to work.

I am openly inviting everyone to put their thoughts on this white paper i have outlined the sections where they can contribute on the github.com 

Questions welcome about finance please refrain tech questions. We will do it later. 

Thanks

Please forward it to respective people.
